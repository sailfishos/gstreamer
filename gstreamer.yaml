Description: |
    GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
    operate on media data. Applications using this library can do anything
    from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything
    else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data
    types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new 
    plugins.
